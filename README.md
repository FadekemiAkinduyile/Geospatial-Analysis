**A. Understanding Purple Martins' Migration Patterns with Geospatial Analysis**

This project aims to provide a comprehensive geospatial analysis of purple martins' migration patterns, highlighting their interaction with protected areas in South America. By visualizing the migration paths and overlaying them with protected regions, this project aids in understanding the critical habitats that support the survival of these birds during their migration.

Project Steps and Features
1. Data Loading and Preparation

2. Birds' Journey Visualization

3. Protected Areas in South America

4. Percentage of Protected Areas

5. Birds in Protected Areas

**B. Proximity Analysis of Hospital Coverage in Response to NYC Crash Collisions**

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of hospital coverage in response to motor vehicle collisions in NYC. By identifying gaps in coverage and proposing new hospital locations, the project aims to improve emergency response times and ensure better access to medical care for collision victims. The analysis supports informed decision-making for urban planning and crisis management.

Project Steps and Features

1. Hospital Data Visualization

2. Identifying Collisions Far from Hospitals

3. Hospital Recommender System

4. Determining Hospital Demand

5. Proposing New Hospital Locations
